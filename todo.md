# Project statement

You have been hired to help develop a blogging website. They would like to have the following client-side functionality:
● The ability to make new blog posts:
○ The new posts should be below the old posts but above the New Blog form.
○ The input fields should be cleared upon submission.
● If there are many blog posts, to enable “pagination” to allow for easy navigation.
○ Pagination is dividing the content to display it on different pages, with the ability to
navigate between the pages.
● It is critically important that you follow good coding practice, so
remember:
○ Descriptive variable names
○ Good comments
■ Explaining what the code does
■ Explaining why the code is structured this way
○ Well formatted and structured code

# ToDo

- as a user, I can add a new blog post.
- new post is below old posts, but above the FORM
  - if we use a data structure that maintains order we don't have to timestamp each blog post.
- input fields cleared on submission

- pagination element that is hidden if number of posts don't

- clear blog fields on submit
